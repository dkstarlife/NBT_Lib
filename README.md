# NBT_Lib
A simple C++ library for decoding and encoding binary Minecraft NBT data.

Use of the library may require a fairly good understanding of modern C++ as well as knowledge about the NBT file structure.

For information about the NBT specifications see either: https://wiki.vg/NBT or https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/NBT_format
