# NBT_Lib
A simple C++ library for decoding and encoding binary Minecraft NBT data. 
The NBT(Named Binary Tag) format is used within the data files used in the game Minecraft, and are usually also compressed. 
For decompression/compression you can use a library such as zlib.

Use of this library may require a fairly good understanding of modern C++ as well as knowledge about the NBT file structure.
I have not done thorough testing of the library yet, and as such there may still be some bugs hiding.

For information about the NBT specifications see either: https://wiki.vg/NBT or https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/NBT_format
